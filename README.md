Finally, decent channel tools for the common person. ADT is a simple bot which allows you to prevent people from adding others to a private channel and preventing others (protect) from *removing* someone from a private channel.

## Commands
- `/adtstatus` - Check the status of a channel.
- `/arm` - Prevents everyone from adding others from a channel
- `/disarm` - Allows anyone to add another to a channel (this is the default for all channel)
- `/protect [user id(s)]` - Prevents the person from being removed from the channel. Also allows the person to enter the channel. Run the command with the same IDs to toggle it off again.

You'll need to authorize ADT first to run in your channels. Visit https://adt.david.hackclub.app/authorize to start.
